# Packet Ripper Logging Documentation

Welcome to the Packet Ripper Logging documentation! The logging feature in Packet Ripper allows you to monitor and analyze log messages generated by both the Packet Ripper program itself and the application injected into.

## Introduction

Packet Ripper provides two logging text fields: one for logging messages generated by the Packet Ripper program (local logs) and another for logging messages generated by the injected application (injected logs). These logs provide valuable insights into the operation of both Packet Ripper and the targeted application.

## Local Logs

The local logs section displays log messages generated by the Packet Ripper program itself. These logs include information about the status of injection, packet resend operations, errors encountered during interception, and other important events related to Packet Ripper's operation.

## Injected Logs

The injected logs section displays log messages generated by the application injected into. These logs contain information about the status of packet resend operations initiated by Packet Ripper, errors encountered within the injected application, common requests such as HTTP requests, and any other logging done by the application.

## Usage

To use the logging feature in Packet Ripper, follow these steps:

1. **View Local Logs**: Check the local logs section to monitor log messages generated by the Packet Ripper program.

2. **View Injected Logs**: Check the injected logs section to monitor log messages generated by the application injected into.

3. **Analyze Log Messages**: Analyze log messages to gain insights into the operation of both Packet Ripper and the injected application. Look for patterns, errors, or unusual behavior that may indicate issues or vulnerabilities.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the logging feature in Packet Ripper:

1. **View Local Logs**: Monitor local logs to check for status updates on injection, packet resend operations, and any errors encountered by Packet Ripper.

2. **View Injected Logs**: Monitor injected logs to check for status updates on packet resend operations initiated by Packet Ripper, errors encountered within the injected application, and common requests such as HTTP requests.

3. **Analyze Log Messages**: Analyze log messages to identify any issues or vulnerabilities in the targeted application's behavior. Look for errors, unusual patterns, or unexpected behavior that may require further investigation.

## Conclusion

The logging feature in Packet Ripper provides valuable insights into the operation of both Packet Ripper itself and the targeted application. By monitoring log messages generated by both the Packet Ripper program and the injected application, you can gain a deeper understanding of network traffic, identify issues or vulnerabilities, and optimize your packet interception and manipulation workflow.
