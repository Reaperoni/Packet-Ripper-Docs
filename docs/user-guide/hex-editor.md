# Packet Ripper Hex Editor Documentation

Welcome to the Packet Ripper Hex Editor documentation! The hex editor feature in Packet Ripper allows you to view and modify hexadecimal data intercepted by the proxy. With the ability to edit hex directly and manipulate data types, the hex editor provides powerful capabilities for packet analysis and manipulation.

## Introduction

The hex editor in Packet Ripper provides a user-friendly interface for examining and editing hexadecimal data. It offers two primary modes of operation: creating a new hex tab or editing hex data linked to a specific intercepted packet.

## Viewing Hexadecimal Data

Upon intercepting packets, the hexadecimal data is displayed in the textbox of the hex editor. Each byte of data is represented by two hexadecimal digits, allowing you to inspect the raw contents of the intercepted packets.

## Editing Hexadecimal Data

To edit hexadecimal data, simply highlight the desired portion of the hexadecimal representation in the textbox and click the "Edit Hex" button. This enables you to modify the selected bytes directly, allowing for precise manipulation of packet contents.

## Manipulating Data Types

In addition to editing hex directly, the hex editor in Packet Ripper allows you to manipulate data types associated with the selected hex. The textbox at the bottom of the hex editor provides options for specifying the data type, such as integer, float, double, etc.

## Creating New Hex Tab

You can create a new hex tab by clicking the "New Hex Tab" button. This opens a new tab in the hex editor where you can enter hexadecimal data manually or paste data copied from external sources.

## Editing Linked Packets

Alternatively, you can right-click on a packet in the Packet Ripper Proxy interface and select the option to edit and resend the packet with the original socket options. This opens the hex editor with the hexadecimal data linked to the selected packet, allowing you to make modifications before resending the packet.

## Updating Hexadecimal Data

After making changes to the hexadecimal representation or data types, click the "Update Hex" button to apply the changes to the intercepted packets. This ensures that the modified data is reflected in the packet stream, allowing for real-time packet manipulation.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the hex editor in Packet Ripper:

1. **View Hex Data**: Upon intercepting packets, the hexadecimal data is displayed in the hex editor textbox.

2. **Edit Hex**: Highlight the desired portion of the hexadecimal representation and click the "Edit Hex" button to modify the selected bytes.

3. **Manipulate Data Types**: Use the options in the data type selection box to specify the desired data type for the selected hex. For example we can type the number 4 in the integer field to update the selected hex with the correponding hex representation of the integer 4.

4. **Update Hex**: After making changes, click the "Update Hex" button to apply the modifications to the intercepted packets.

## Conclusion

The hex editor feature in Packet Ripper provides powerful capabilities for analyzing and manipulating hexadecimal data intercepted by the proxy. Whether you're inspecting packet contents, modifying data on-the-fly, or experimenting with different data types, the hex editor offers flexibility and control for packet analysis.
